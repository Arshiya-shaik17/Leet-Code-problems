# LeetCode Solutions in Java

This repository is a growing collection of my Java solutions to LeetCode problems. I'm using this space to practice data structures and algorithms, improve my coding skills, and prepare for technical interviews.

Each solution is written with a focus on clean, understandable code and well-thought-out logic. I’m also staying consistent with problem-solving — one step at a time.
